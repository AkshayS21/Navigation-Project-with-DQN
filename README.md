# Navigation-Project-with-DQN
Using the Deep Q-Learning Network to train an Agent for Navigation


### About the environment:

For this project, I trained an agent to collect learn navigation in a Unity-ML type environment.
Specifically, the trained agent will navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world to maximize its rewards.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. 

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.
